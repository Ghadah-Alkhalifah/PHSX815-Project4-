# PHSX815-Project4 :Monte Carlo Simulation of 2D Ising Model using Metropolis Algorithm
## How to run the code:
+ start with 'file1.py' it will simulate the model using monte carlo method and will save the date to file `simulation_data.txt` and then print the value of critical temperature with uncertainity value.
+ run `file2.py` it will read the txt file and will plot two figures of specific heat and energy for ferromagentic materials. 
No change in pramaters through terminal, but you still can change the parameters values from the python file.
